Coverage Metric Example (using Coverlet or Visual Studio):

PhoneFileLoaderTests.cs:
- WB_FL_001_FileNotFound_ReturnsNull: 1 branch, 1 covered (100%)
- WB_FL_005_SingleField_ProducesError: 2 branches, 2 covered (100%)
- WB_FL_011_ValidEntry_AddedToList: 2 branches, 2 covered (100%)

PhoneSystemTests.cs:
- WB_PS_001_InitializesPhoneStatesToOnhook: 1 branch, 1 covered (100%)
- WB_PS_101_StartCallCreatesCallAndUpdatesStates: 2 branches, 2 covered (100%)

Total Coverage: 100% for tested methods

To generate actual coverage:
- Run tests with Coverlet or Visual Studio Test Explorer
- Export coverage report
- Review uncovered lines/branches and add more tests as needed
